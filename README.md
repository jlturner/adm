# ADM (Adaptive Drum Machine)
ADM (pronounced "Adam") is an adaptive drum machine program.

The initial goal for this project is to create a drum machine program that produces 1 bar drum loops in 4/4 time. It also is responsible for creating optimal drum samples by combining one or more samples at different volumes. It uses genetic algorithms to recombine drum loops and adapt to a user scored value (human input as a heuristic).

ADM optimizes for the user's ever changing preference - coinciding with the Adaptive Tools manifesto.
